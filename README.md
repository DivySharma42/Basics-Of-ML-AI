# 🧠 Machine Learning Daily Journal

Welcome to my daily Machine Learning learning journal! This repository documents my journey as I explore the theory, implement projects, and grow my skills in the field of Machine Learning — one day at a time.

## 📌 Purpose

This repo is my commitment to **consistency** and **continuous improvement**. By learning in public, I aim to:

- Track my daily progress
- Reinforce my understanding through documentation
- Share insights, challenges, and solutions
- Build a valuable resource for others on the same path

## 📅 Structure

Each day is organized as a separate entry in the folder, including:

- 📖 Concepts learned
